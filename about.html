            <p>LIGTAS is a student-created website dedicated to promoting disaster preparedness and safety in our school and local community. Our goal is to provide clear, reliable, and easy-to-understand information that helps people stay safe before, during, and after emergencies. We believe that preparedness is the key to resilience.</p>

            <p>We built this website to raise awareness about common local hazards such as fires, earthquakes, floods, and landslides. By sharing helpful tips, safety guidelines, and preparedness reminders, we hope to empower individuals and families to respond confidently in times of danger. Our aim is to make essential safety knowledge accessible to everyone.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle-about">Our Commitment to the Community</h3>
            <p>This project reflects our commitment to helping our community become more informed, prepared, and resilient. Through LIGTAS, we aim to inspire safety, responsibility, and readiness for everyone, creating a safer environment for our students and neighbors alike.</p>
